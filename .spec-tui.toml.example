# spec-tui Configuration File
# Copy this file to your project root as .spec-tui.toml
#
# Configuration hierarchy (later overrides earlier):
# 1. Built-in defaults
# 2. Project config (.spec-tui.toml in project root)
# 3. User config (~/.config/spec-tui/config.toml)
# 4. Environment variables (SPEC_TUI_*)

# Worktree configuration
[worktree]
# Directory where git worktrees are created (relative to project root)
# Each spec branch gets its own worktree in this directory
directory = ".worktrees"

# MCP (Model Context Protocol) client configuration
[mcp]
# Transport type: "stdio" (default) or "http"
type = "stdio"
# Request timeout in seconds
timeout_seconds = 60

# For HTTP transport, uncomment and configure:
# type = "http"
# endpoint = "http://localhost:8080/mcp"

# UI configuration
[ui]
# UI refresh rate in milliseconds
# Lower values mean more responsive UI but higher CPU usage
refresh_rate_ms = 100

# Enable vim-style navigation (j/k/h/l keys)
vim_navigation = true

# Git-related configuration
[git]
# Directory containing spec folders (relative to project root)
# Each spec is a folder like: specs/001-feature-name/
specs_directory = "specs"

# Main branch name (used as base for new branches)
main_branch = "main"

# Environment variable overrides:
# SPEC_TUI__WORKTREE__DIRECTORY - Override worktree directory
# SPEC_TUI__UI__VIM_NAVIGATION - Override vim navigation (true/false)
# SPEC_TUI__UI__REFRESH_RATE_MS - Override refresh rate
# SPEC_TUI__GIT__SPECS_DIRECTORY - Override specs directory
# SPEC_TUI__GIT__MAIN_BRANCH - Override main branch
# SPEC_TUI__MCP__TIMEOUT_SECONDS - Override MCP timeout
